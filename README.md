## ðŸš€ Setting Up Automatic Startup

### Option 1: Using Task Scheduler

1. **Set Up Task Scheduler**:
   - Open Task Scheduler (press Windows key and type "Task Scheduler")
   - Click "Create Basic Task..." in the right panel
   - Name: "WhisperDictation"
   - Description: "Runs WhisperDictation app at startup"
   - Trigger: Choose "When I log on"
   - Action: "Start a program"
   - Program/script: Browse to and select the `run_whisper_dictation.vbs` file

2. **Configure Advanced Settings**:
   - After creating the task, find it in Task Scheduler Library
   - Right-click and select "Properties"
   - In "General" tab:
     - Check "Run with highest privileges"
     - Change "Configure for" to your Windows version
   - In "Conditions" tab:
     - Uncheck "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power"
     - Uncheck "Stop if the computer switches to battery power"
   - In "Settings" tab:
     - Check "Allow task to be run on demand"
     - Check "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed"
   - Click "OK" to save

3. **Testing the Setup**:
   - Right-click the task in Task Scheduler
   - Select "Run"
   - Try the Ctrl+Alt hotkey to verify it's working

Note: The task won't appear in Task Manager's Startup tab as it uses Task Scheduler instead. To disable automatic startup, open Task Scheduler, find the WhisperDictation task, and select "Disable".
